# Disaster-Tweet-Classification-Model

To build and deploy a machine learning model using Flask. The application exposes an API endpoint that accepts text input, processes it using a vectorizer, and returns predictions generated by a pre-trained model.

Model Details
Model Type: Pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
Vectorizer: TF-IDF or CountVectorizer for text preprocessing.
vectorizer.pkl: Vectorizer used for input preprocessing.
requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.
The model processes textual inputs and predicts the target class or outcome based on trained patterns.
